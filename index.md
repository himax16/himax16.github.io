Welcome to my personal website!

I am a sixth year graduate student in the [Princeton Program of Plasma Physics](https://plasma.princeton.edu) currently working for [Prof. Matthew W. Kunz](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~kunz/Site/Welcome.html) in the Departement of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University.

My main research interest is in the **high-performance simulation** of fundamental plasma process, mainly in astrophysical systems.

I grew up in [Malang, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malang) before obtaining my Bachelor of Arts (_A.B._) for Physics from Princeton University in 2018. Outside of my research, I have various interests which can be seen from my [personal blog posts](/blog/).
