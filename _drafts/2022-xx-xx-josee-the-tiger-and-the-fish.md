**Josee, the Tiger and the Fish 「ジョゼと虎と魚たち」** is a short story written by **Seiko Tanabe** which was part of the eponymous short story anthology which was first published in 1985. Since then, the story have been adapted into two live action movies in Japan (2003) and in [Korea (2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9e_(film)) as well as [an animated movie (2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josee,_the_Tiger_and_the_Fish_(2020_film)). This review will focus on the animated movie story while comparing it to the original story as well as the Korean live action movie. I will also discuss some other short stories written in the original anthology to give additional context about the theme.

# TL;DR
_**What happens when you are faced with things beyond your control?**_

The story revolves around the wheelchair-user protagonist, who called herself Josee, and his caretaker who got entangled with her due to an accident. The story explores the theme of facing the challenges (tiger) of your dream (fish), dealing with _status quo_, and the meaning of sacrifice. The animated movie is definitely worth watching due to its comedic yet reflective method to deliver the message. Combined with excellent music scores and vibrant art style, it should be enjoyable for everyone. The original short story and Korean live action movie offer different interpretation to answer the three main points of the story and probably worth to be read or watched.

Beyond this point, the review will contain **heavy spoiler** from the animated movie, original short story, and the Korean movie.

# Review of the Animated Movie
Our paraplegic female protagonist Kumiko, who prefers to be called Josee, have to use the wheelchair to get around. She lives with her grandmother (Chizu Yamamura) who takes her out in the night, hoping that it will be safer as they would not be seen by the others. One day, Kumiko's wheel chair rolled down the hill uncontrollably. Luckily our male protagonist Tsuneo happened to pass by and caught her.

After that, Tsuneo accepted the offer to be Josee's _caretaker_ for saving more money. Before meeting Josee, Tsuneo had been living frugally while working in a dive shop with Yamato and Mai, his two coworkers. Tsuneo did all of this in order to fund his dream studying abroad in Mexico and diving along with a school of [clarion angelfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarion_angelfish).

> _"The outside (world) is full of scary beast"「外は恐ろしい猛獣ばかり」_

It is the phrase that Chizu always repeats to Josee to justify her inaction, keeping Josee isolated from the outside world. This bring us to the first point of the story, **dealing with _status quo_**. Being trapped in the house with her reluctant grandmother, Josee had to give up her dreams of seeing the outside world. She indulged herself in painting and reading, especially the work of Françoise Sagan, from where she got the name Josee. Only after Tsuneo came along, Josee tried to face her beast
